{"date":1438329367000,"text":"You don't have food poisoning. It's not the flu. You don't have an infection. If you're nauseous right now, it's just a panic attack. I've been submitting and contributing to this subreddit for a few weeks now, and I've come across a good handful of people who experience panic attacks like mine: with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and even a low-grade fever. Let's get through this together, guys and gals:\n\nIt isn't food poisoning. Food poisoning sets in within the first 30 minutes of eating contaminated food. You aren't sick. It's not e.coli. It's not salmonella. Your brain just wants to pretend it is.\n\nFever below 101F? Nauseous? Feeling some tummy trouble? Vomiting resulting from an infection isn't something you can hold back. There isn't a slow buildup of nausea until you start retching. If you have the flu, it's gonna come out fast. Unless you taste sulfur (like rotten eggs) when you burp a little, you aren't going to throw up. If you DO throw up anyway, it's your brain deceiving you into exhibiting the symptoms of the thing you're afraid of. You're okay. Even if you're still being sick, you WILL be okay. It WILL go away. It's okay if you can't help it. You aren't weak for succumbing. You haven't failed. It's just bad, rampant hormones. It will go away.\n\nBaby yourself through this. Treat yourself well. Listen to your instincts about what you need to get through this. Want to camp out in your bathtub so the toilet is right nearby? Grab yourself some pillows, blankets, water, saltines, and your phone or computer. Camp out. Even if it's in a funny place like your bathtub or your hall closet - if you feel safe there, go there. It WILL help.\n\nBreathing exercises work for some, but not for everyone. \"Happy thoughts\" work for some, but not for everyone. If you find that deep, cleansing breaths and picturing daisies swaying in the springtime breeze doesn't do a damned thing for you, that doesn't mean it's not a panic attack. It just mean your disorder has an extra-tough candy coating of \"fuck you\". There are other ways to get through it. You'll figure them out in time. Until that time comes, focus on positioning yourself so you at least feel in control of your environment. Nest. Stay hydrated. Take an antacid - it will help with the reflux. If you've got diarrhea, take an imodium (half a pill to start with - follow the directions on the bottle) or some pepto bismol (pink bismuth)(Do NOT take a separate antacid and imodium alongside pepto. It's one or the others). The chemistry and pH in your digestive system is thrown off by your panic. That's why you feel sick.\n\nNow, let's get some white noise going. Some people find comfort in music. Some don't. I, personally, find a lot of comfort in writing to you guys and watching comforting tv shows. Here are some links, all of which are free and available for streaming (make sure your adblock is on. These sources have been very good about limiting any phishy stuff, but better safe than sorry):\n\n[Mythbusters](http:\/\/watch-series-tv.to\/serie\/mythbusters)\n\n[Good Eats](http:\/\/watch-series-tv.to\/serie\/good_eats)\n\n[Bill Nye, the Science Guy](http:\/\/watch-series-tv.to\/serie\/bill_nye%3A_the_science_guy)\n\n[Planet Earth](http:\/\/watch-series-tv.to\/serie\/planet_earth)\n\n[Walking With Beasts](http:\/\/watch-series-tv.to\/serie\/Walking_with_Beasts)\n\n[Hidden Kingdoms](http:\/\/watch-series-tv.to\/serie\/hidden_kingdoms)\n\n[Holmes on Homes](http:\/\/watch-series-tv.to\/serie\/holmes_on_homes)\n\n[The Magic School Bus](http:\/\/watch-series-tv.to\/serie\/the_magic_school_bus)\n\nI find the above shows really comforting because, not only are they light in plot content, but they're educational and engaging. When you're engaging the learning center of your brain, it can help distract you from feeling sick and panicky. That same website has a ton of available shows to watch - take a look around and look for whatever you like :) \n\nAnother, more obscure, site that I sometimes use [plays the Animal Crossing hourly music in real-time according to your timezone](http:\/\/tane.us\/ac\/)\n\nYou're gonna get through this. It's nothing more than misfires in your brain causing a big, fat release of stress hormones. Those stress hormones can not only cause hyperventilation and feelings of impending doom, but it can also pretend to be the flu or food poisoning. It's neither of those things.\n\nTreat yourself like your ideal, doting momma would. Picture the ultimate comforting figure. What would they do for you if you were this sick? Would they build you a pillow fort? Bring you water and your favorite stuffed animal? Your baby blanket? If you cowered in the bathtub for 4 hours straight, would they give you blankets, pillows, and put on The Magic Schoolbus? Do it. I don't care if it's emasculating. I don't care if it seems childish. In times like these, babying ourselves can be the best medicine.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, it's absolutely, 100% okay to feel this sick. This panic disorder is just that: A disorder. When epileptics have seizures, we don't shame them for it. When a person with Crohn's Disease has a flare-up, we don't shame them for it. Just like with autoimmune diseases, just like with epilepsy, just like with any other chronic disorder, we can't control our symptoms. We can't control when they're going to hit us. Medication and therapy can help, yes, but FORGIVING ourselves can also help. Letting ourselves just be sick, just be anxious, and just be panicky without trying to power through it is okay. You're not weak for needing to do that. You're just letting this ugly little bout take its course. Sometimes, leaning back, hunkering down, and waiting for the storm to pass is the kindest thing you can do for yourself, and can be the fastest way out of it. You're gonna get through this.\n\n**tl;dr:** Treat yo self. You'll be alright. You're awesome, guys; no matter how crappy (sometimes literally) you may feel right now. It'll go away, and this subreddit is gonna be here whenever you need it.\n\nedit: formatting","subreddit":"Anxiety","username":"Guenhwyvere"}

I just don\u2019t really get sick ever (thank god, I know I\u2019m lucky). I\u2019m 25 and I honestly haven\u2019t had a flu in my adult years, so I haven\u2019t ever had to monitor my own symptoms and take care of myself with a chest cough like this before. I\u2019m hoping someone can ground me in reality and let me know what is\/isn\u2019t normal with this stuff? \n\nI\u2019m on day 6 of this flu, fever\u2019s been gone for a couple days, overall starting to feel better. But the chest congestion is making me lose my mind. I\u2019m hyperaware of the stuff in my chest\/windpipe, and have been obsessively coughing to try to get it all out asap. Most of the time my coughs are unproductive, probably because I\u2019m forcing it, and all this coughing is making me lightheaded and dizzy. Sometimes I do cough up actual mucus (maybe like 20% of my coughs are productive) but it hasn\u2019t gotten rid of the congested chest feeling. \n\nIs this normal when first getting over a sickness? Am I overthinking this? My fear is that if I let mucus sit in my lungs, it\u2019ll become pneumonia or an infection. I also keep thinking that the congestion in my lungs might be reducing my oxygen levels and I just won\u2019t realize it until I collapse. Especially since i keep feeling lightheaded and dizzy. I know there are more rational explanations for that feeling (not eating enough, coughing way too much) but I keep thinking \u201cwhat if\u201d and then obsessively coughing just in case, and then making myself more dizzy. I hate this. I\u2019ve never passed out in my life, but one of my biggest OCD fears right now is feeling like I might pass out, especially when I\u2019m alone.\n\nBtw I\u2019m doing everything I can to loosen up the congestion. Humidifier, mucinex, plenty of water, even vibrations on my upper back\/chest to break up the mucus. All those things are helping for sure. I just worry it\u2019s not enough.

I\u2019ve only had one true panic attack in my life and that was two year ago after I overdosed on caffeine but nothing since then and the panic attack from two years ago was nothing like what happened last night.

In a panic I popped one of my anxiety pills and slowly the sweating stopped, and my vision came back. When the nurse checked me out my BP was 110\/50 and my fever was 102. She told me that sometimes when a fever spikes it can cause the feeling pre syncope to happen. I told her I have anxiety and I wasn\u2019t sure if because I was sick my body was acting up.
